The Arduino Smart Bridge project is designed to address the challenges of flood management by automatically opening and closing a bridge based on water level measurements obtained using a soil moisture sensor. This project utilizes Arduino microcontroller technology, a soil moisture sensor, and a servo motor to achieve its objective.

Flooding is a recurring natural disaster that leads to severe damage to infrastructure and loss of lives. To mitigate these effects, we have developed an Arduino-based Smart Bridge system that can automatically respond to rising water levels, as determined by a soil moisture sensor, by opening the bridge to allow water to pass. This project aims to enhance flood management in low-lying areas and provide a cost-effective solution for communities prone to flooding.

The Arduino Smart Bridge system comprises three main components: a soil moisture sensor, an Arduino microcontroller, and a servo motor. The soil moisture sensor continuously measures the moisture level in the soil, and when it reaches a predetermined threshold, the Arduino triggers the servo motor to open the bridge.
